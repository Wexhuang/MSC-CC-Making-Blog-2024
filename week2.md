# Week 2

### Labs

In the labs this week, we completed several foundational activities to familiarise ourselves with Arduino and basic electronics:

- **Lab 1.1:** **LOVE-O-METER**  
  The first project was using a temperature sensor to turn the ARDUINO into a love machine. I connected the circuit on a breadboard, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment when I saw the LED gradually light up and blink according to the temperature of my fingertip.

- **Lab 1.2:** **LIGHT THERIMIN**  
 Next, I tried using a photoresistor and a piezoelectric element to recreate a light-based THEREMIN instrument. I am very interested in how the sound is produced, and it excites me that a simple movement can control the sound!
