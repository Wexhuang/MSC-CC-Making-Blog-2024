# Week 2

### Labs

In the labs this week, we completed several foundational activities to familiarise ourselves with Arduino and basic electronics:

- **Lab 1.1:** **Love O Meter**  
  The first project was using a temperature sensor to turn the ARDUINO into a love machine. I connected the circuit on a breadboard, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment when I saw the LED gradually light up and blink according to the temperature of my fingertip.

- **Lab 1.2:** **Light Therimin**  
 Next, I tried using a photoresistor and a piezoelectric element to recreate a light-based THEREMIN instrument. I am very interested in how the sound is produced, and it excites me that a simple movement can control the sound!

- **Lab 2.1:** **Level 1: Explore Adafruit LED Strip Examples**

This was my first time exploring Adafruit LED strips. I learned how to install and use the library, and I experimented with the effects from the library and changed the timings.

- **Lab 2.2:** **Level 2: Create My Own Patterns**

Then I started trying to create my own lighting patterns by using a for loop to light up the LEDs on the strip one by one. In each iteration, the next LED would turn blue. I aimed to achieve a ‘gradually advancing wave’ effect through the combination of dynamic blue and a fixed green.

- **Lab 3.1:** **Different Circuit configurationC**

After comparing series and parallel circuits, I found that parallel LEDs are brighter because each LED can receive sufficient voltage and independently draw the required current.
