# Week 1

### Labs

In the labs this week, we completed several foundational activities to familiarise ourselves with Arduino and basic electronics:

- **Lab 1:** **LED Blink**

First up was the classic LED blink project. I set up my circuit on a breadboard, and when I uploaded my first sketch - seeing the LED light up and blink according to my code was so rewarding! It felt like magic, and I couldn't help but smile at my tiny victory.
